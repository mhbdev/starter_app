## Getting Started ðŸš€

This is a starting point for a new brick.
A few resources to get you started if this is your first brick template:

- [Official Mason Documentation][2]
- [Code generation with Mason Blog][3]
- [Very Good Livestream: Felix Angelov Demos Mason][4]

## Installation Guide

* Make sure your flutter is on **stable** channel and its version is above **3.7.3**
* First of all make sure you **clear the cache** of your mason github repository
Run the command below:
`mason cache clear`
* Run the command below to add **starter_app** globally to your mason repo:
`mason add --git-url https://github.com/mhbdev/starter_app.git -g`
* After adding this brick you can make a new flutter project from this template right away by running this command:
`mason make starter_app`

> **Note:**: Meanwhile mason is trying to create a new project for you it will ask you to overwrite some files. make sure you 'Y' them all or just add `--on-conflict overwrite` to `mason make starter_app` command.
